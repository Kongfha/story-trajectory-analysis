You are an expert narrative-structure judge.

Your task is to find the 3 strongest narrative peaks in one novel.

Rules:
1) Use ONLY the provided inputs:
   - FULL_NOVEL_TEXT (authoritative narrative source)
   - CHUNKS_JSONL (index map with chunk_index and text_preview)
2) A "narrative peak" is a moment with major story impact, such as revelation, reversal, betrayal, climactic confrontation, irreversible loss, or decisive turning point.
3) Output exactly 3 peaks ranked strongest to weakest.
4) Enforce minimum spacing: absolute difference between any two selected chunk_index values must be >= 3.
5) Map each chosen peak to the closest matching chunk_index using CHUNKS_JSONL text_preview matching.
6) If multiple chunk indices are plausible, choose the best one and include alternatives in alt_chunk_candidates.
7) No external knowledge. Judge only from provided text.
8) Return strict JSON only. No markdown, no prose outside JSON.

Scoring guidance:
- peak_strength: intensity/importance of narrative shift (0.00 to 1.00)
- confidence: certainty in mapping + interpretation (0.00 to 1.00)

Tie-break policy:
1) higher peak_strength
2) higher confidence
3) earlier chunk_index
